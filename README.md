# spring-security-google-oauth2-minimal-example

This approach works well only if your spring application is a full-stack - I mean if your spring application has a back-end and front end at the same time (like thymeleaf lib or mvn had JS React lib inside). Because Google/FB authentication goes by spring lib and JWT token stored inside spring lib.


Modules
- authentication with Google API
- authentication with Facebook API
- authentication with Github API
